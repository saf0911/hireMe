# Starter repository for fullstack application using next.js

This is a starter repository created for Austin Coding Academy to quickly
start a fullstack application using next.js

## Installation

Install all dependencies running `yarn`

## Usage

Run the dev server via `yarn start`

### Setup
* Create a new repository on github, clone it onto your maching
* Download (not clone) the files from the repository https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/advanced-nextjs-express-starter and copy them into your new project. Make sure all the files are at the top level. So inside of your folder you should have the .eslint, package.json etc on the very top level
* yarn install, yarn start
* Don’t use this readme to figure out what code to type
* Use all other projects we have done as code examples
* Pick a real life thing to use as a model. Vehicle, Product, Movie …etc
* Implement 5 properties for this model.

### React
* Create a page as a class based component that list out a collection of your models (ListOfUsers)
   // * Use prop types to define what props the component needs
   // * It should probably need a prop named after the plural of your model, and it should probably be an array
   // * Probably want to map over this array and create some divs or li’s showing 3 of the properties of the item
    **todo wire this to backend* Create a Link on each item so you can navigate to the detail page
    **todo wire this to back end* Create a button on each item so you can delete the item
* Create a page with a class based component that makes a new model (redux fetch practice)
    * Create a form and a button
    * Put a label and an input for each property your model has
    * Bonus - use a drop down if there are a limited number of values for a property
    * Register onChange for each input and use setState to store the information typed in
    * Register onSubmit for the form.
    * onSubmit call an action called createThing(change it to make sense for your model) Remember to connect this via mapDispatchToProps etc.
* Create a page with a class based component that shows details of one thing (UserDetail)
    * Use a prop that has the array of your models
    * Use a parameter from the route path ?id=<id> to find the model to show (See Routing secion for more details)
    * Use whatever html you want to show all of the properties of your thing
* Loading data
    * Trigger the loading of data inside componentDidMount of the pages, call loadThings

### Routing
* For the basic routes without variables you can just use the next.js routes that are automatically generated.
* For the routes that need data (for detail / update view the ID of the item for example), read the documentation on routing for Next.js https://github.com/zeit/next.js#routing Play around with the URLs, links and console.log in your own project to figure out how to get the URL parameter into your component.

### Redux
    * First create a minimum working example to setup redux within next.js, refer to example in next.js repository or last lessons video screencast
    * The only state you need is an array of your models
        * state.js
<!--    * Create actions for loading your models and models loaded-->
<!--        * loadThings() - do a fetch get to “/things”-->
<!--        * thingsLoaded(things) - THINGS_LOADED-->
<!--    * Create an action for saving a new model-->
<!--        * createThing(thing) - do a fetch post to “/things”-->
<!--        * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings-->
<!--    * Create an action for deleting an item-->
<!--        * deleteThing(id) - do a fetch delete to “/things/” + id-->
<!--        * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings-->
<!--    * Create reducer for the state-->
<!--        * care about the action THINGS_LOADED-->
    * To connect your components to redux, use the withRedux decorator as described in the redux example in next.js repository. If you need to create Containers in components further down in your component tree, create containers as usual.
        * mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps
        * The list component container should mapStateToProps for the array of things
        * The list component container should mapDispatchToProps for the deleteThing action
        * The new thing component container should mapDispatchToProps for the saveThingAction
        * The individual pages should mapDispatchToProps for loadThings to get your initial data.

## Server - use advanced-express-practice as an example
<!--* The code for this goes in /src-->
<!--* Use express to create a server listening on port 3001-->
<!--* Use mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database called “checkpoint2”-->
<!--* Create a Model for your thing-->
<!--* Create a Route and Controller for your thing-->
<!--* In the Route, create routes for getting all things, getting one thing by id, deleting one thing, updating one thing, and creating one thing-->
<!--* In the Controller, create functions for list,show,create,update,remove-->

## Styling
* Add styling to your components via Style JSX. See documentation of Next.js repository: https://github.com/zeit/next.js#css

## Points
* When I yarn start, the web page loads with no errors - 10pts
* I can navigate to the list and create screen from links - 10pts
* I can enter information into the create screen and click save. If I go back to the list screen, that new information is there. - 20pts
* If I go to the list screen it will show all current existing information - 20pts
* The list screen has a view link for each item. If I click that link the detail screen appears. The details of the item are shown. - 20pts
* If I click the delete button on the list, the item I clicked will be removed from the list - 20pts


## Extra Credit
* Edit Component
  * Create a component to edit your things. It will be almost the same as the create component.
  * Use a prop that has the array of your models
  * Use a parameter from the route path ?id=<id> to find the model to show
  * Populate the properties of the model into the inputs
  * onSubmit populate the information from state back into the model, call a prop function called updateThing(thing)
* Create a container for the edit component
  * mapsStateToProps for the array of models
  * mapDispatchToProps for an action updateThing
* Create an action updateThing(thing)
  * do a fetch put to "/things/" + thing._id
  * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings
* Add a page to the edit container with a variable ?id=<id>
* In the list components, add a Link for the edit route.

## Bonus
* Create the edit component by reusing the create component
